# chord-transcriber (WIP)

# Aim: to identify chords from songs recorded as .wav files.

# Current functionality: loads a .wav and splits the waveform into harmonic and percussive components, computes a fast Fourier transform at many time samples to generate and plot a melodic spectrogram, picks out the strongest frequencies in each spectrum and maps these to notes.
